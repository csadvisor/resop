CURIS matching for project: "Slacking Off: the New Working Hard"

Student: James Chen
Mentor: Jonathan Hollin Tilley

Dear James Chen,

You have been matched as part of the CURIS program, to the
project above. The program this year was extremely competitive,
with 15 applicants, of which we could select only 8. You are
one of this small group. Congratulations!!

As part of the program, you will receive a stipend of $0 for
the entire 10 week period.

Please let both me and your mentor know by Friday, July 16,
whether or not you accept this offer. Also, please let us know
if you do *not* need the on-campus housing. As the number of
qualified applicants was significantly larger than the number of
positions, we would like to use any vacancy for other students.

Congratulations again,

Jonathan Tilley
CURIS Program Testing Coordinator
