Dear curis applicant,

Thanks so much for your interest in the program, but unfortunately there were more fake applicants than fake spaces available currently for fake workers.  However, there will be a fake second round, so be sure to update your fake applications (and apply for the new fake project: Never Gonna Give You Up) and hopefully we can fake accept more of you!

Thanks again!
Jonathan Tilley
